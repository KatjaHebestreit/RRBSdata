  abstract = {The origin of aberrant DNA methylation in cancer remains largely unknown.
	In this study, we elucidated the DNA methylome in primary Acute Promyelocytic
	Leukemia (APL) and the role of PML-RARα in establishing these patterns.
	APL patients showed increased genome-wide DNA methylation with higher
	variability than healthy CD34+ cells, promyelocytes and remission
	bone marrow. A core set of differentially methylated regions in APL
	was identified. Age at diagnosis, Sanz score and Flt3-mutation status
	characterized methylation subtypes. Transcription factor binding
	sites, e.g. c-myc binding sites were associated with low methylation.
	SUZ12 and REST binding sites identified in embryonic stem cells were,
	however, preferentially DNA hypermethylated in APL. Unexpectedly,
	PML-RARα binding sites were also protected from aberrant DNA methylation
	in APL. In line, myeloid cells from pre-leukemic PML-RARα knock-in
	mice did not show altered DNA methylation and expression of PML-RARα
	in hematopoietic progenitor cells prevented differentiation without
	affecting DNA methylation. ATRA treatment of APL blasts did also
	not result in immediate DNA methylation changes. These results suggest
	that aberrant DNA methylation is associated with leukemia phenotype
	but not required for PML-RARα-mediated initiation of leukemogenesis.},
